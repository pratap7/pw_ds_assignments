        "       - **Reusability**: Through inheritance, existing classes can be reused and extended — reducing code duplication.\n",
        "       - **Data Security (Encapsulation)**: Encapsulation hides the internal data of objects and exposes only what’s necessary, protecting data from accidental modification.\n",

        "       - **Abstraction:** Abstraction hides complex details and shows only essential features, simplifying program design.\n",
        "       - **Maintainability:** Since classes are modular and independent, updating or fixing one part of the code doesn't affect others.\n",
        "       - **Code Reusability and Collaboration:** OOP promotes reusable components and makes it easier for multiple developers to work on large projects simultaneously.\n"
